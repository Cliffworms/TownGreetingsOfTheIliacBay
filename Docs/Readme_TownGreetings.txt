1. DESCRIPTION
===============

Town Greetings of the Iliac Bay adds 41 descriptive messages that show upon arriving at a village, hamlet or city.
The message briefly describes the settlement and informs you of the current date, thus bringing flavor to your travels. 

The texts come from the Elder Scrolls I : Arena and have been edited to fit in Daggerfall's world.

Either install using Vortex Mod Manager or install manually as described below.
